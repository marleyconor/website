<p>I'm Conor. I'm a product designer that has been working in EdTech since 2019. My main areas of focus are desktop and mobile web design, accessibility, user research, usability testing, and design system management.</p>
<p>I love the work I do. It is very important to me that digital products are usable, useful, accessible, and pleasant.</p>
<p>My role also includes design manager, as I have mentored and worked with multiple interns at CourseNetworking, leading to a high job placement rate.</p>
<p>I have a cat named after a character in The Sopranos. I am slowly learning to make sushi at home. I am a competitive Magic: The Gathering player, recently competing in US Nationals.</p>
<p>This site was designed and developed by myself using Figma, HTML, and CSS following semantic WCAG development standards.</p></div>
