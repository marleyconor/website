<h1>Designing a learning management system for Zoom</h1>

<div id="intro problem" class="overall">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>During the pandemic move to online learning, CourseNetworking saw an opportunity to make Zoom classes much easier for instructors and students. <strong>Using our existing social learning management system (LMS), we designed, developed, and launched a Zoom-integrated LMS.</strong> This allowed students and teachers to access lesson materials, manage homework, and deliver quizzes inside of a Zoom meeting.</p>
</div>

<div class="grid">
    <div id="goals" class="overall">
        <h3>Our Goals:</h3>
        <p>Students in teachers at every level of eduction were quickly moving to remote learning, the majority of which is via Zoom.
        <p>Our goals:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Help users maximize the learning time that they are already spending inside of Zoom.</strong></li>
        <li>Provide effective classroom learning and tools virtually</li></ul></p>
    </div>
    <div id="audience" class="overall2">
        <h3>The Audience:</h3>
        <p>Through user research we determined that our target audience for the Zoom app would fall into <strong>two broad categories of instructors and students:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Professors with low to medium tech literacy that have used Zoom in the past but not to this degree.</li>
        <li>Students with high tech literacy that have used Zoom in the past in courses.</li></ul></p>
    </div>
    <div id="role" class="overall">
        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <p>CourseNetworking is a small company, and the team for the Zoom app project was around 5 people.</p> <p><strong>As the lead designer, I conducted user research, managed the full-stack user experience design process, coordinated with the development team, and oversaw testing.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div id="scope" class="overall2">
        <h3>The Scope:</h3>
        <p>The size of the team was a significant factor in how the design process was structured. <strong>There is no dedicated user research team, so I personally managed both the UX research and design.</strong></p> 
        <p>This extended the length of the design process but gave me a deep understanding of the problem.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <h3>User Research to understand needs:</h3>
        <p>To understand our user base, I began conducting user research by interviewing existing CN users who were engaging with education remotely. These interviews were conducted over Zoom and lasted about an hour. I wanted to find out about how they use learning management systems, Zoom, and course materials, as well as determine how those fit together. </p>
        <div class="quote">My goal was to be able to move forward with a foundation of understanding our users' needs, and not have to rely on guessing what those might be.</div>
        <p>Through this process, <strong>I learned that instructors and students both struggled with connecting with their peers. They can also feel overwhelmed by the amount of new remote technology, so the sign-in process needs to be extremely easy.</strong></p>

        <p>This provided us an opportunity to step in as a social LMS complete with posting and ePortfolio features. I also determined that course materials need to be accessed easily and immediately for instructors. Zoom meetings were mostly lectures and note taking for students. Teachers tended to use the LMS features more during class than students did.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="overall">
        <h3>UX Project plan for an overview of a large project:</h3>
        <p>To get a better idea of next steps and timeline, I created a UX project plan. This document detailed every next step in the UX design and final development process and who would be responsible for each step. </p>
        <div class="quote">As a designer working alone, this process helped me understand a realistic timeline and workload for myself for this large project.</div>
        <p>It also had the very helpful benefit of demonstrating and explaining parts of the UX design process to my colleagues who were not as familiar with it.</p>
        <img src="img/zoom02.jpg">
    </div>

    <div class="overall">
        <h3>Design Brief to summarize research and orient project</h3>
        <p>I wanted a single, easily-digestible document to pass out to stakeholders to demonstrate the value of UX research and explain what I had learned in the research process.</p>
        <div class="quote">The design brief helped orient goals and outcomes to everyone on the team in the same direction early on in the process.</div>
        <p>The main thing I wanted the team to keep in mind was the goals of the users. The instructors and students both needed the Zoom app to be very simple and easy to understand, as they would already be using multiple new technologies due to the shift to remote learning.</p>
        <img src="img/zoom03.jpg">
    </div>

    <div class="overall">
        <h3>Personas to generalize research and focus user flows</h3>
        <p>To summarize my research and create reference points for my team, I created personas that <strong>served as a central focus for the design process and helped build empathy for our users.</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The instructors using this app need an interface that is very simple and gives them quick access to course materials.</li>
            <li>Students want to access their grades and feedback as well as being able to communicate with classmates.</li>
        </ul>
        The simplicity that both groups require led to our 1-click signup option later in the design.</p>
        <img src="img/zoom04.jpg" style="border-style:none;">
    </div>

    <div class="overall">
        <h3>User Flows to understand what the app needs to be able to do</h3>
        <p>Using the information I gathered from the interviews and referencing the personas, <strong>I began making task flows to lay out the user goals and determine how we could get them there smoothly.</strong></p>

        <p>An important part of this step was considering where users would start, and how they might be able to navigate back and forth between steps to ensure a comfortable experience. This process significantly influenced the navigation of the design and ensured users could always change decisions in the signup process.</p>
        <img src="img/zoom05.jpg">
    </div>

    <div class="overall">
        <h3>Sketching to quickly communicate first draft of the app</h3>
        <p>After the user goals and flows were established, I began sketching out ideas for what the app would look like.</p>
        <div class="quote">Sketching allows me to rapidly create visuals, have others contribute or share feedback, and save myself time and the company money.</div>
        <p>Something this process revealed early on was the complexity of some of the course material pages. This helped us early on reduce the number of options in the course home page and keep the sign-up process simple.</p>
        <img src="img/zoom06.jpg">
    </div>

    <div class="overall">
        <h3>Wireframing to start to lock in element placement</h3>
        <p>With wireframing, I was purposeful about button and navigation placement using existing visual elements, using the personas as guides to getting closer to a final design.</p>
        <div class="quote">Wireframing was an opportunity for myself and the other team members to get a complete view of the system.</div>
        <p>Drawing from the work of the previous phases, I began to finalize the simplified signup, login, and course creation process. I began working with the developers on making sure that the process was technically feasible.</p>
        <img src="img/zoom07.jpg">
    </div>

    <div class="overall">
        <h3>Prototyping to start reviewing and testing</h3>
        <p>I had two goals with the prototype which was created in Figma:
        <ul>
            <li>create a complete visual interface for approval by business stakeholders,</li>
            <li>and a working, clickable prototype to conduct user testing with.</li>
        </ul>
        Because this was before I had created the <a href="system">CN design system</a>, and that it was a non-web app, I was working outside of the regular design language we use on the website version of the platform.</p>

        <p><strong>This final design step brought together all of the previous research</strong></p>

        <p>A 1-click login was added, the account creation flow was simplified, an agile navigation was implemented, and the course creation process was reduced to 2 pages.</p>
        <img src="img/zoom08.jpg">
    </div>

    <div class="overall">
        <h3>User Testing to validate design decisions</h3>
        <p>With a completed prototype, I created goal-oriented task lists for instructors and students, and asked them to complete those tasks. These tasks included:
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a new account</li>
            <li>Finding a course</li>
            <li>Creating a course</li>
            <li>Making a post</li>
        </ul>
        The testing revealed that we had some confusing messaging about how many courses an instructor could create. To remedy this, <strong>we changed the logic and the messaging to be much more straightforward.</strong> This eliminated the problem for instructors.</p>

        <p>With the constraint of a very small team and a low budget, I utilized the students and instructors on the college campus that I work on for testing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="overall">
        <h3>Development to create final product</h3>
        <p>After the user testing phase was complete and usability issues were resolved, the developers began work on the front-end development.</p>
        <p>I lead the testing and QA feedback to the developers via Jira while they worked directly from my Figma file and design documents.</p>
    </div>

<div class="overall" id="conclusion" style="border-bottom-style: solid;">
    <h2>Launch</h2>
    <img src="img/zoom09.jpg">
    <h3>What happened:</h3>
        <p>After launching the first public release in the summer of 2022, <strong>we received thousands of new users from the Zoom app. This signifies an increase in user retention of 8.5%.</strong> I marketing team also reported significant interest from prospective clients about the product.</p>

        <p>CN recently secured our first client that uses the CN zoom app for their institution.</p>
    <h3>Goals achieved:</h3>
        <p>The app we created went a significant distance in achieving out product goals. <strong>The Zoom app succeeded in helping users have more meaningful class time in Zoom by providing social LMS functionality through our post feed discussion tools.</strong> It was later determined that some of the course tools provided like Quizzes and Homework management were less helpful for live Zoom lectures, as the user research indicated might be the case. However, these tools were previously built into CN, and required no extra development time.</p>
    <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
        <p>This design process demonstrated to me the significant importance of good user research and understanding who your users are. <strong>With robust and accurate research, you are able to save a significant amount of time on guessing or discussion, while also avoiding including features that are not useful for your users.</strong> Good early research helps save time on each step, points you in a clear direction throughout the design process, and is foundational to a smooth UX design process.</p>
